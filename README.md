# Hobby Page
This is a hobby page for my founders and coders application.

## Steps i took to make the website
- I started work on the site at the Founders and Coders Meetup, using what i had learnt from FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Classes.
- I encountered some issues with coding the site so I took a step back and decided I needed a plan. 
- I came up with a basic plan in Figma (see the .pdf in this respository)
- I returned to editing HTML and CSS, this time much more focussed, now I had a clear idea of what I wanted the site to look like.  
- I used the word "Spiekerfann" as a bit of a play on words on Erik's surname, an elision of Spiekermann and fan. 
- In struggled to get the site's footer to stick to the bottom of the page, so I used the developer tools to test several different ways of doing it (found by googling and reading stack overflow articles). I liked the speed with which developer tools allowed me to do this. The solution I found worked for my needs was applying this to footer: ```bottom:0px``` and ```position:fixed```.
- From there, I tested the site using my mobile and the responsive design mode in Firefox developer tools and made several edits as necessary.
- I was happy with the site but decided I wanted the site's text to be a bit longer to avoid it looking too static, like an image or .pdf. 
- Just for fun, I used ChatGPT to generate some extra copy here. 
- After getting to a good level in Javascript, I read the resources on the DOM and worked out how to set the current date and time on the page. I realised I had to set the time zone to "Europe/London", instead of UTC because of Daylight Saving Time. 

For a more detailed explanation of how I made this site over time, see the commits.
